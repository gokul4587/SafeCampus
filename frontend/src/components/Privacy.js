                    <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to Campus Safe. Your privacy and trust are incredibly important to us. This policy explains in simple terms how we handle your information and protect your anonymity.</p>

                    <h2>Anonymous Reporting</h2>
                    <p>The core feature of our site is the anonymous reporting form. When you submit a report, we do not collect any personal data like your name, email, or IP address. The system is designed to ensure your identity remains completely confidential.</p>

                    <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
                    <p>We do not use tracking cookies or analytics that could identify individual users. We only care about the information you voluntarily provide in the report to help us address the issue, not who you are.</p>

                    <h2>How Information is Used</h2>
                    <p>The content of anonymous reports is shared only with authorized university personnel (such as campus security or wellness coordinators) who are trained to handle sensitive information. The data is used solely for the purpose of investigating the reported issue and improving campus safety.</p>

                     <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
                    <p>Our "Learn" and "Get Help" pages contain links to external resources like YouTube and national helplines. Please be aware that these sites have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their practices.</p>

                    <h2>Questions?</h2>
                    <p>If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to reach out to the student wellness office. We are here to help.</p>
